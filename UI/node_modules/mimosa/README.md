## Quick Start

There are a ton of docs on [the site](http://www.mimosa.io) to get you started, but here's a quick start.

* Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).  A `.10` version.
* `npm install -g mimosa`
* `mimosa new testproject`
* Follow the prompts to choose some assets
* `cd testproject`
* `mimosa watch -s`
* http://localhost:3000

Now you are ready to rock!

Maybe you want to start with something other than an empty app?  Maybe you want to start with a preconfigured Ember app for instance?

`mimosa skel:list`

That will get you a list of the skeletons currently available for Mimosa that might help jumpstart your app.
